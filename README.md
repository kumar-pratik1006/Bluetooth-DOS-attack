# 🔥 Bluetooth DoS Attack Script (For Educational Use Only)

This project demonstrates a basic **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** attack targeting Bluetooth-enabled devices using Python and system tools. It is intended **strictly for educational and ethical hacking purposes** — to learn about vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.

> ❗ **Disclaimer:** This repository is meant for cybersecurity learning and ethical testing on devices you own or have permission to test. Do not use this script to attack others' devices without consent — doing so is illegal and unethical.

## 🧠 What is a Bluetooth DoS Attack?

A **Bluetooth Denial of Service attack** overwhelms a Bluetooth device with connection requests or malformed packets, making it unresponsive or disconnecting it from other devices.

This script uses command-line Bluetooth tools (`l2ping`, etc.) to simulate a DoS by flooding a target device with pings.
